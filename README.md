# Odin Project - CSS Foundations Exercise B

Practice adding ID or Class attributes to several elements.

## UX

**User Stories**

1.  As a user, I should see a `yellow` background for all odd numbered elements in the list.

2.  As a user, I should expect a `class` selector for all odd numbered elements in the list.

3.  As a user, I should see the second element in the list with `blue` text and a `font-size` of `36px`.

4.  As a user, I should expect the `font-size` and text color on the second element to be set by using an `id` attribute.

5.  As a user, I should see that the third element in the list has a `font-size` of `24px`.

6.  As a user, I expect the `font-size` on the third element to be set by using a `class` attribute.

7.  As a user, I expect the fourth element in the list to have a `red` background, a `font-size` of `24px` and a `font-weight` of `bold`.

8.  As a user, I expect the `font-size` of the fourth element to be set with a `class` attribute.  The `font-weight` and the color should be set with an `id` attribute.
